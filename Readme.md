This is my personal set-up configuration. Here’s a breakdown of why I chose each tool and how they enhance my workflow:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - [**Neovim**](https://neovim.io/) - Text Editor  
>   I prefer using Neovim as my text editor because of its extensibility and its modern take on the classic Vim editor. Neovim supports Lua scripting, making it incredibly fast and responsive, and allows for a highly customized environment tailored to my exact needs. Additionally, the vibrant community and extensive plugin ecosystem make Neovim a powerful choice for both coding and text editing tasks.
>
> - [**Wezterm**](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) - Terminal Emulator  
>   I use Wezterm as my terminal emulator because it combines speed with flexibility. Its GPU-accelerated rendering makes it one of the fastest terminals available, and it includes features like support for multiple tabs and panes, true-color, and smooth font rendering. Wezterm also offers configuration through a Lua-based API, enabling deep customization to match my setup preferences and improve my terminal experience.
>
> - [**Zellij**](https://zellij.dev/) - Tiling Terminal Multiplexer  
>   Zellij is my choice for a terminal multiplexer because it provides an intuitive tiling experience out of the box. Unlike other multiplexers, Zellij focuses on usability, with built-in keybindings and layouts that make it easy to split, organize, and manage terminal sessions. Additionally, it supports plugin systems and is designed with extensibility in mind, making it ideal for users who want to customize their workspace.
>
> - [**Fish Shell**](https://fishshell.com/) - Shell  
>   I use Fish Shell due to its user-friendly and intelligent design. Fish provides a powerful autosuggestion feature, syntax highlighting, and easy scripting that make command-line tasks faster and more intuitive. Its straightforward configuration doesn’t require as many setup steps as other shells, which lets me get productive quickly without compromising functionality or performance.
>
> - [**Homebrew**](https://brew.sh/) - Package Manager  
>   Homebrew is my preferred package manager because it offers a simple and efficient way to install and manage packages on Unix-based systems. Its extensive repository of tools, along with its clean syntax (`brew install`), makes it easy to keep my system up-to-date. Additionally, Homebrew works seamlessly with custom taps, making it adaptable to a wide range of environments.

This setup prioritizes speed, customization, and usability, allowing me to tailor my environment to my preferences and work style. Each tool enhances my productivity by providing powerful features with minimal overhead, making this configuration ideal for a flexible and efficient workflow.
With this set-up, I can easily manage my development environment and work efficiently.
