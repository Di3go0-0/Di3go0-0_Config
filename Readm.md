  - **Efficient workflow**:  
    With Neovim’s keybindings and LazyVim’s configurations, I can navigate and edit code effortlessly, avoiding the mouse and boosting my productivity.

  - **Active community and constant updates**:  
    Both Neovim and LazyVim have thriving communities that ensure continuous improvements, new features, and support for the latest tools.
