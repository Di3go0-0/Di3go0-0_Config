# Development Environment setup

Hi there! This is a guide to setup the development environment.

## Tools

This is my personal set-up configuration.

- [Nvim](https://neovim.io/) - Text Editor --> I prefer using Nvim as my text editor. It is a highly customizable text editor and has a lot of features.
- [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) - Terminal Emulator --> I use Wezterm as my terminal emulator. It is highly customizable and has a lot of features.
- [Zellij] - Tiling Terminal Multiplexer --> I use Zellij as my terminal multiplexer. It is highly customizable and has a lot of features.
- [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/) - Shell --> I use Fish Shell as my shell. It is highly customizable and has a lot of features.
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - Package Manager --> I use Homebrew as my package manager. It is highly customizable and has a lot of features.
